# CMPE255_Assignment2
This assignment aims to teach us how the no-code machine learning and low-code machine learning works and how these two things simplify model building.  Task 1: Auto ML(no code) The task was to demonstrate at least one auto ml project using JadBio, but JadBio was not working for me at the moment so I tried searching for alternatives and found DataRobot. I used DataRobot for demonstrating the 2 projects. 

Demonstration video links are as follows:

Task 2: Low Code ML The task was to learn how pycaret can be used to do low code ML and make different types of models. Using Pycaret I have implemented 
Binary Classification
Multiclass Classification
Regression 
Clustering
Anomaly Detection 
Time Series Forecasting - Univariate without Exogenous Variables
Time Series Forecasting - Univariate with Exogenous Variables
 
Datasets used for this task: 
Binary Classification: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database
Multiclass Classification: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009

The assignment further asked to predict the values using GradIO library, using which a User Interface is created and we can predict the values of our model and check how accurately the model created using Pycaret works. The links for demonstration of GradIO can be found below:
